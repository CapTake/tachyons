  # CUSTOM MEDIA QUERIES

  Media query values can be changed to fit your own content.
  There are no magic bullets when it comes to media query width values.
  They should be declared in em units - and they should be set to meet
  the needs of your content. You can also add additional media queries,
  or remove some of the existing ones.

  The media queries are min-width based meaning that the medium
  breakpoints apply to all devices that are the medium min-width
  or larger.

  These media queries can be referenced like so:

  ```css
  @media (--breakpoint-medium) {
    .medium-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }

  @media (--breakpoint-large) {
    .large-and-larger-screen-specific-style {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
  ```

*/

/* Media Queries */
@custom-media --breakpoint-medium screen and (min-width: 30em);
@custom-media --breakpoint-large screen and (min-width: 60em);
